## Problem Statement:
In the contemporary landscape, the escalating demand for energy, coupled with the 
proliferation of electronic devices, has led to a surge in power consumption, posing significant 
challenges to sustainability and resource management. Individuals and organizations often lack 
the means to comprehend and control their energy usage, resulting in both environmental and 
economic consequences. This sets the stage for the development of the Energy and Power 
Consumption Calculator App.
##  EXISTING SYSTEM:
As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there were various energy and power 
consumption calculator apps available, each with its own set of features and capabilities. 
However, the landscape of mobile applications is dynamic, and new apps may have emerged 
since then. Here is a generalized overview of the characteristics commonly found in existing 
systems or apps focused on energy and power consumption calculation:
Some existing apps provide basic energy calculators that allow users to estimate the energy 
consumption of their household appliances and devices. These calculators often rely on average 
power ratings and usage patterns.
Smart home platforms and devices often come with built-in energy monitoring features. Users 
can track and manage the energy usage of connected devices through a central interface. These 
platforms may offer insights into individual device consumption.
